A report from Vincenzo Gervasi <gervasi@margot.di.unipi.it>:
"Also, the plugin
often produces several sudden increases of the volume level in a row,
with... ehm... interesting effects on the nerves of my office mates. You
should probably test it on a machine with sound hardware."

both xmms + plugin GTK configuration window freeze, when I try configure 
plugin.
I use xmms 1.2.2 (debian package), plugin version 0.3.4 and ESD daemon instead
of direct access to /dev/dsp.
	
The directories glade and config are not part of the distribution.
