1. Stuff that was implemented and needs testing:

Change nothing until the queue is filled, this will reduce the song
start noise.

The user should set a minimum power to adjust, below it we change
nothing and consider it as silence.
The user should set a maximum multiplier.
(Needs to add this to the UI, currently it can be changed in compile time only)

2. Stuff that needs doing:

Make sure that the sample size is small enough, not larger than 1/100 of a 
second worth of data.

Add i18n support.

Remember the maximum power level of the song when it stops playing so
that next time we will have the maximum level from the start. However,
even if there is a maximum the plugin should try to find the maximum again
and save the newly found maximum for next time, this is good for
retraining if a song was changed from last time or if the song was not
heard to its full length last time.

Find a way to search the power of songs from the playlist when they
are not played (for example by using a timer and a low priority thread).

Allow the user to set the size of the queue.

Need to keep tab of the multiplier so that clipping will not occur.
