WHAT IT IS
	The volume normalizer plugin is intended to change the volume of playing 
	songs to some level such that they all will basically sound pretty much 
	the same in terms of volume.

INSTALLATION
	./configure
	make
	su -c "make install"

USAGE
	If XMMS was working, restart it.
	From the Preferences dialog of XMMS select the Effects/General Plugins
	page.
	Select in the Effects plugins the Normalize Volume plugin and enable it.
	You can launch the configuration dialog and choose to what level it will
	modify all songs, the default is 0.25.
