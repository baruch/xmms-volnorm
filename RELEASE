This is to document the stages to be done in a release.

1. Verify compilability on local machine, with:
	make clean all

2. Verify loading as an XMMS plugin with:
	make check

3. Creating the source distribution with: make dist

4. Uploading the source distribution to sourceforge.net with:
	ncftpput download.sourceforge.net incoming <file>

5. Commiting everything into CVS at cvs.volnorm.sourceforge.net

6. Tagging the CVS with a tag of the form: release_MAJOR_MINOR_PATCH
	for example release_0_3_4 for version 0.3.4

7. Creating a release on sourceforge.net

8. Updating the homepage to show the new version.

9. Uploading the LSM and source distribution to ibiblio

10. Announcing on freshmeat.net from the page:
	 http://freshmeat.net/projects/volnorm/
	(This can be skipped if it's a minor release)

11. Notifying the XMMS folks about this new release so they update their pages.
	 Who should be contacted? E-Mail address?
