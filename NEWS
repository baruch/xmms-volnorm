	Releasing version 0.3.4 - still a development version.

	After a set of faulty releases this finally should be able to compile, load
	and possibly even work. The new features for artifact reduction are still
	untested and are unknown if they work.

	Releasing untested version 0.3 - consider this a development version.

	This should fix the artifacts at the beginning of the songs, though the
	parameters cannot be changed from the UI yet. They can be changed in the
	XMMS config file though.

	Released version 0.2

	Fixed the problem with the song change detection, it now works! Altough it
	will be better if there was some support for this in XMMS plugin 
	architecture.

	Initial public release of version 0.1
	
	This is still lacking, I found no way to know when the song changes so it
	currently normalized the volume over all songs with the maximum found 
	which is plain wrong. But at least this plugin is a move toward a working 
	volume normalizer for XMMS.
