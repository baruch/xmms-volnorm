	Released version 0.2

	Fixed the problem with the song change detection, it now works! Altough it
	will be better if there was some support for this in XMMS plugin architecture.

	Initial public release of version 0.1
	
	This is still lacking, I found no way to know when the song changes so it
	currently normalized the volume over all songs with the maximum found which is
	plain wrong. But at least this plugin is a move toward a working volume
	normalizer for XMMS.
