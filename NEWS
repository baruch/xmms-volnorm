	Releasing version 0.9 - development version.

	Added compression support, sound compression in the sense that you can
	define a threshold and a divider to reduce the dynamic range of the sound.
	It should help when listening to classical music with large variations
	in it's perceived volume, it is supposed to allow better munging of the
	volume.

	Releasing version 0.4 - a stable version.

	This fixes install problems, and fixes for minor bugs in the configuration
	dialog.

	Releasing version 0.3.5 - a stable version.

	In this version I eliminated all the known bugs and problems, the sound
	quality has improved and various artifacts have been squashed.

	This version adds a test suite of one test for plugin loadability.

	Releasing version 0.3.4 - still a development version.

	After a set of faulty releases this finally should be able to compile, load
	and possibly even work. The new features for artifact reduction are still
	untested and are unknown if they work.

	Releasing untested version 0.3 - consider this a development version.

	This should fix the artifacts at the beginning of the songs, though the
	parameters cannot be changed from the UI yet. They can be changed in the
	XMMS config file though.

	Released version 0.2

	Fixed the problem with the song change detection, it now works! Altough it
	will be better if there was some support for this in XMMS plugin 
	architecture.

2000-08-28

	Initial public release of version 0.1
	
	This is still lacking, I found no way to know when the song changes so it
	currently normalized the volume over all songs with the maximum found 
	which is plain wrong. But at least this plugin is a move toward a working 
	volume normalizer for XMMS.
